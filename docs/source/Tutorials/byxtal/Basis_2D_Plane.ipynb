    "The first step in simulating interfaces is the determination of the two-dimensional periodicity (i.e. the basis vectors) of the plane. The interfaces are two-dimensional sections of the underlying three-dimensional lattice, and hence, the interface will exhibit the periodicity of the corresponding 2D lattice of the plane. The technique to determine the basis vectors is outlined in the following article:\n",

    "## Miller Indices and Conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Miller Indices are often used to refer to a given crystallographic plane in crystals. \n",
    "2. However, various conventions are commonly used in determining the Miller Indices that can change the indices of the plane. For example, in the FCC lattice, one could either use the cubic unit-cell or the primitive cell to index planes and directions, resulting in completely different indices for the same plane. Therefore, we would like to declare our conventions in defining the Miller Indices to avoid potential confusion. \n",
    "3. By definition, the Miller indices of a plane, denoted by $(h \\, k \\, l)$, refer to the indices of the lattice vector perpendicular to the plane expressed in the reciprocal lattice. Therefore, the indices will depend on the reference lattice used (e.g. the cubic unit-cell or the primitive cell).\n",
    "4. In the **byxtal** package, we perform the calculations in the primitve cell. The reason simply is that, in the primitive lattice, all the lattice points are expressed using integers. This helps with some of the algebraic manipulations that are preformed in the package.\n",
    "5. **Unless otherwise specified, the indices in byxtal package are in reference to the primitve cell.**\n",
    "6. In the present tutorial, we also discuss how to convert the indices from one reference frame to the other (e.g. from the primitive cell to the cubic unit-cell).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[//]: # \"Miller Indices are defined as the reciprocal of intercepts of a crystallographic plane with the Unit Cell Basis Vectors. The confusion is often caused by the definition of the Unit Cell. In f.c.c and b.c.c lattices primitive basis vectors are non-orthogonal while the supercell basis vectors are orthogonal. Most importantly since the reciprocal and direct lattices are the identical in f.c.c and b.c.c, the Miller Indices (defined in supercell unit cell) are the same as the plane normal indices. This unique property and convenience of using an orthogonal set of basis vectors is the root cause of the bipartisan approach to defining the Miller Indices. The downfall of such an approach is the fact that it does not have much utility in other types of lattices e.g. hcp. Therefore in GBpy whenever we use the term Miller Indices, we are referring to the reciprocals of intercepts of a crystallographic plane with the primitive Basis Vectors.\"\n",
    "[//]: # (Miller Indices: reciprocal of intercepts of a crystallographic plane with the primitive Basis Vectors, or alternatively, Miller Indices: normal vector indices of the plane defined in primitive reciprocal lattice. The above interchangeable definitions are consistently used in GBpy for referring to Miller Indices. Other conventions in defining the Miller Indices are ultimately converted to the above definition. In the present tutorial we manually extract various Indices and demonstrate how they can be fed to the GBpy. In practice such conversions are not necessary as long as the user is consistent with the definitions of GBpy, and can be used for verifying the answer.)\n",
